# VBA_Challenge
## Overview
Steve is helping his parents to figure out the stocks that they could invest the money in. Their is a lot of 
date that he needs to analyze to get to the decision. His parents are very interested in Green Energy. As
their are many forms of green energy but his parents decided to invest everything in DAQO stocks. Steve is now
analyzing the data of green energy in addition to DAQO to find out the best option of stocks for his parents to ''
invest in. Steve has all the date on excel and their is a way to analyze data in excel through formulas. But using 
VBA can automate this analysis more efficeintly and timely. At the cick of a button the data will be analyzed.

## Results
We created a VBA code to analyze data which would run more efficiently and provide the results we are looking for.
Steve's parents are very interested in DAQO stocks and if we see the data for this particular stock in the year 2017
it was good as return for this stock was 199.4%. But if we see the return for it in 2018 it drastically dropped down
to -62.6%, which means that this stock is fluctuating year after year and the reults are very uncertain.
Now to see which stocks is a good investment would be RUN. If we see the data both of this stock in 2017 it was 5.5%
but in 2018 it jumped to 84% which shows that there is potential in it and it would give out a good turn.

Another aspect that we considered during coding is the efficiency of the code. Which means how efficient and fast the 
code performs to give out the results. We refactored the code and included a MsgBox to show the time it took to ran,
images attached for reference. My code ran for 0.07 for both years.

## Summary
If we talk about advantages of refactoring the code, then its that refactoring gives out better quality code. It's
easier to read and less complex. The disadvantages are that it is time consuming as you have to go over each and every
syntax and sometimes it can take you to a place where you would not know what to do next. 

In this particular VBA code the pros are for sure the code is easier to read and maintain which means
that later on if we want to add anything into it we would be able to do it as its very well organized.
The cons in this code did come up when I was writing this code to a point that I could not figure out why the
code was not giving the required output but kept on just running on one row. I went over it so many times and then
had the help of TA who also couldn't see what the problem was. But we eventually decided to write the code in a new
VBA window and it was able to run perfectly fine.
